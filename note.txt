!! what I learned !!

//Javascript

1. addEventListener('mousemove')
- when a pointing device is moved, mousemove event is fired at an element.

2. event.clientX, event.clientY / screenX, screenY
- clientX and clientY provide the coordinates within the application's viewport.
- screenX, screenY provide of the mouse pointer in global(screen) coordinates.
- 'screenX/Y' vs 'clientX/Y' vs 'pageX/Y'
  => 'screenX/Y' are from monitor(screen).
  => 'clientX/Y' are from browser window.
  => 'pageX/Y' are from web page (total page's length).

3. why using transform?
(https://www.lmame-geek.com/css-triggers/)
- if using style.top or style.left, browser will operate layout, paint, composition in order.
- It degrades performance, but if using transform, browser will operate only composition.
